    "## Project -- Wheel of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will take you through the process of implementing a simplified version of the game Wheel of Fortune. Here are the rules of our game:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are `num_human` human players and `num_computer` computer players.\n",
    " - Every player has some amount of money ($0 at the start of the game)\n",
    " - Every player has a set of prizes (none at the start of the game)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The goal is to guess a phrase within a category. For example:\n",
    " - Category: Artist & Song\n",
    "  - Phrase: Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Players see the category and an obscured version of the phrase where every alphanumeric character in the phrase starts out as hidden (using underscores: _):\n",
    " - Category: Artist & Song\n",
    " - Phrase: _______ _______'_ _ ____ ______ ____ ___\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Note that case (capitalization) does not matter\n",
    "- During their turn, every player spins the wheel to determine a prize amount and:\n",
    " - If the wheel lands on a cash square, players may do one of three actions:\n",
    " - Guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed by typing a letter (a-z)\n",
    "  - Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) cost \\$250 to guess and can’t be guessed if the player doesn’t have enough money. All other letters are “free” to guess.\n",
    "  - The player can guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed and gets that cash amount for every time that letter appears in the phrase\n",
    "  - If there is a prize, the user also gets that prize (in addition to any prizes they already had)\n",
    "  - If the letter does appear in the phrase, the user keeps their turn. Otherwise, it’s the next player’s turn\n",
    "  - Example: The user lands on \\$500 and guesses ‘W’\n",
    "   - There are three W’s in the phrase, so the player wins $1500\n",
    "  - Guess the complete phrase by typing a phrase (anything over one character that isn’t ‘pass’)\n",
    "   - If they are correct, they win the game\n",
    "   - If they are incorrect, it is the next player’s turn\n",
    "  - Pass their turn by entering 'pass'\n",
    "  \n",
    " - If the wheel lands on “lose a turn”, the player loses their turn and the game moves on to the next player\n",
    " - If the wheel lands on “bankrupt”, the player loses their turn and loses their money but they keep all of the prizes they have won so far.\n",
    " \n",
    "- The game continues until the entire phrase is revealed (or one player guesses the complete phrase)"
